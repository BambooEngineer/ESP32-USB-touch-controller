# ESP32-USB-touch-controller

ESP32 sends capacitive touch presses to a python script through Serial USB. 

The Python Script converts the incoming bytes into actual keyboard presses. Its not perfect but its actually not that bad it just cant hold buttons. 
Works fine with the snes9x emulator for street fighter 2 and mortal kombat 3.
